# Equivariant Predictive Models and Structural Causal Model Identification

This repository is Grace's master project "On the Relationship between Equivariant Predictive
Models and Structural Causal Model Identification". It contains the [report](https://github.com/graceyin06/invariant-model/blob/main/grace_master_report.pdf) and [slide](https://github.com/graceyin06/invariant-model/blob/main/master_slide-18.pdf).


> Structural Causal Models (SCMs) are a key component in causal inference and they have been used for a long time in many fields. We proposed an approach to identify the structure of an SCM based on Constant Risk Theorem. In particular, we proved that for an equivariant model and predictor, the risk function is constant across interventions described by the action of a group. These theories give a straightforward understanding of certain types of causal model identification. We also explored the risks on a specific SCM for linear regression predictive models with different types of interventions through
simulation experiments.
